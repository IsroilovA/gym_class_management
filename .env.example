# --- Nginx / Reverse Proxy ---
# Nginx is the only service that exposes a host port (80, and 443 with TLS).
# Gunicorn (app) is internal-only on the Docker network.
#
# Production checklist:
#   1. Set ENVIRONMENT=production — this enables SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT,
#      SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER, HSTS, and secure cookies automatically.
#   2. Do NOT set ENVIRONMENT=production until TLS is configured in Nginx,
#      or SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT will cause redirect loops.
#   3. To add TLS later: update nginx/default.conf with ssl certificates,
#      expose port 443 in docker-compose.yml. No Django changes needed.
#
# Local development: port 80 works over plain HTTP with ENVIRONMENT=development.
# If port 80 is already in use, change "80:80" in docker-compose.yml (e.g., "8080:80").

# --- TLS Certificates ---
# Place fullchain.pem and privkey.pem in the ./certs/ directory.
#
# For local development, generate self-signed certs:
#   openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
#     -keyout certs/privkey.pem -out certs/fullchain.pem \
#     -subj "/CN=localhost"
#
# For production, use real certificates (e.g., Let's Encrypt certbot).
